Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

The commenting out of the seq and linenum variables makes it so that the read in
code has errors and cannot read. If gc_count was commented out then the code 
gc_count = gc_count +1 would not work because of the use of the variable before
it has a value.

Problem 4:

at_content: 0.568993851852

Collaboration:

Worked by self

Reflection:

Changing the original code to run one loop instead of more is essential to saving
time when running the bigger data sets.
